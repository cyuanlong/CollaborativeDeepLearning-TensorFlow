This is the author's officially unofficial TensorFlow implementation of CDL. Note that the code is a simplified version of CDL and is used for demonstration only.

#### To train the model
* pretrain model (CDL)
    run 'python train_sdae.py'
* train CDL
    run 'python train_cdl.py'

#### To evaluate performance
* run lib/mainEvaluate.m under Matlab

#### Other materials

* More details on the work and some direct extensions can be found at http://wanghao.in/CDL.htm.

* Matlab version for full CDL: https://github.com/js05212/CDL.

* MXNet version for simplified CDL: https://github.com/js05212/MXNet-for-CDL.
